In this digitized and fast moving world, the general public who take pleasure in reading books find it strenuous to their pocket to buy every book they want to read. 

The alternative to this would be either to visit a library or borrow the book from a friend. Again, a huge majority of people rarely or never visit a library. Also, usually in a person’s friend circle, the majority don’t read books. This poses several problems for the person thereby making it quite difficult in finding a person who can provide them with the particular book. 

Swapping books is a common practice among book groups, friends and colleagues at work, it provides an inexpensive way for people to exchange books, find out about new books and obtain a new book to read without having to pay.

Another problem that persists for bookworms is to talk to someone to share their feelings or thoughts regarding a book. Sometimes a person is judged for reading either too many books or reading certain kinds of books. This leaves them alone with their bubble of thoughts. Talking to a person who can relate to them will be beneficial for the person to speak freely without the fear of being judged. 

Swapit offers a platform for Bookworms and amateur readers alike to exchange their books and meet people with whom they can exchange their thoughts.
